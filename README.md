# Railroad
This program implements Kruskal's algorithm to build a minimum-cost railroad system in a Minimum Spanning Tree. It utilizes disjoint sets with path compression and union by rank to determine which cities to connect. It outputs the list of city connections lexicographically, with the total and each of their costs.
